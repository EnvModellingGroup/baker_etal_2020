# Baker et al, 2020

Code and scripts for paper "Modelling the ecological impacts of tidal energy barrages". The SDM modelling was carried out in R using the dismo package. This was wrapped in a python script to carry out the multiple runs and manage data. Finally a shell script then ran both the non-food-web and foor-web versions 10 times each.

The layers used are contained within the CSV file and the layers are raster files (GeoTIFF) in the Data directory.
