Code and scripts for paper "Modelling the ecological impacts of tidal energy barrages". The SDM modelling was carried out in R using the dismo package. This was wrapped in a python script to carry out the multiple runs and manage data. Finally a shell script then ran both the non-food-web and foor-web versions 10 times each.

The layers used are described within the CSV file for each species and the layers themselves are raster layers available here: [10.6084/m9.figshare.11297480](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.11297480)
