Location data were downloaded from NBN atlas so have not been uploaded here. The data were downloaded and transformed into UTM 30N using QGIS. The CSV data downloaded were loaded directly into Q, then converted to to shapefile in UTM space, ensuring the geomoetry columns were added as X,Y. Any obviously odd points (e.g. on land) were removed at this time too. This was then saved as a CSV again using QGIS. The CSV file names are contined within the species_layers.csv file. Either match those or edit that file to match your filenames. Once CSV file per species.
